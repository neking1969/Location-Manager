# How This Project Syncs

## You Don't Need to Do Anything

Just use Claude Desktop normally on both computers. Everything syncs automatically.

## What Syncs Automatically

✅ **Code Changes** - Auto-pushes to GitHub when commits happen
✅ **Dependencies** - Auto-installs when needed

## Switching Computers

**Before leaving:** Close Claude Desktop, walk away
**On other computer:** Open Claude Desktop, everything is synced ✓

## Adding Data Files Later

If you add a `data/` folder later, run:
```bash
setup-sync
```

This will connect it to Google Workspace drive automatically.
